Hello! My name is Daniele, I was born in 1997 and I'm enrolled at the University of Camerino (Italy).
I'm currently studying for my BCs degree in Computer Science. 
I'm planning to write on this blog about my interests and my projects.
I really enjoy the GNU/Linux system and the open source communities.

Feel free to drop me a line at:
